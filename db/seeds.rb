I hope you enjoy, and feel free to leave comments or criticisms as appropriate. Thank you.-\nEdwin Cast was your (mostly) regular guy living and working in Kentucky. He had a knack for working, and was always bouncing from job to job as fancy took him. Insatiably curious, he was always on the look out for new or interesting information or things to do. You could say he was a ‘hard-work fanatic’.\nBut with an ailing mother and the inability to realize that he was being shunned by those considered his ‘betters’, he met his mortal end at the hands of those people who he replaced. Beaten to death on the same day his mother died, he’s soon pulled from the void into a world beyond his own imagination. \nReborn into a fantasy world as the last ‘Demon Lord’, Edwin is expected to rule over a vast number of races, each of which are considered ‘monsters’ and demon-kin by the zealous human kingdoms of the world. And if that wasn’t enough, the only way to progress and make ends meat is to build and control ‘Dungeons’ for the righteous humans to invade!\nEdwin will have to give it his all in a world he never expected even existed, and will have to learn to survive with his wits and growing power in order to establish something resembling peace in the war-torn lands of Eternia.\n-NOTE: I’m still in the process of working on the storyline, characters, and abilities that will be presented. A large number of themes are planned, and mature/adult content is planned. The story may also be a bit slow in some cases, so please bare with me. Thanks again!\n-NOTE: People have been mentioning the rough grammar and spelling errors that come with my posts; and while I’ve said so in the forum comments, I’m going to post it here as well. This is all basically a rough draft. I post the chapters as I write them, with only a spell-check for accuracy. None of the chapters are proofread. Once people point out blatant errors, I try to correct them; but otherwise I’m more interested in writing. \nIf anyone wishes to proofread my work, shoot me a PM on the forums!

Since im taking no freedom with his personality its going to be by the books your going to need some info before hand to get the full picture.\nFirst lets start off with the two rules in the batman universe.\n1)”The moment batman kills is the moment batman falls.”Or for the ignorant if batman kills someone he is no longer the batman.\n2)”The Joker’s full origin must be fully understood.” This is because the moment The Joker is fully understood the moment he becomes less scary. Because we feared the unknown.\nNext order of business is the jokers personality disorder is A.S.P.D and to sum it up they fight against the “man”(Jokers case would be batman), Have no remorse in killing people and have crazy outburst.\nAlso should note that in all The joker Stories There were never told from a first person view point because you are never meant to understand whats going on in Jokers mind. But im going to half to break that rule mainly for the purpose that in re:monster you are meant to understand whats going on inside the MC head quite different from The Joker. So i came up with the idea To swap Between The jokers perspective and a third party observers perspective. That person will change depending situation whether it was the god who sent him here or something (whether it be monster or a person) watching him. This will be used to describe what The Jokers actions are etc because this would be The Joker with out theatrics.\nAnd side note even though its going to be hinted at in the story for those who didnt get said hint the joker doesnt just want to kill batman he wants to break the batman or in others he want the batman to kill someone and fall into insanity. Then and only then would he truly be finished. All the crimes he commits are just to have a stab at “breaking the bat”.\nfor a more in depth look i have cited sources that my help you understand fully were im coming from\nJokers origin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WalgYTQjHTc\nkilling joke\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bym2xLEDR5s&list=PL6FhCd_HO_AAwx6IROb_vSwRVaCuc9efL&index=1\ndeath of the family\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a36V6oni9Mw&index=2&list=PL6FhCd_HO_AAwx6IROb_vSwRVaCuc9efL\nCategories: Action , Comedy , Drama , Fantasy , Crossover , Tragedy , ", home_url: "http://royalroadl.com/fiction/1192", is_translated: false, raws_url: nil, number_of_chapters: 0, last_modified: "2015-11-07 00:16:48"},

  {name: "Re: Accel Rush", description: "A new breed of humans have started to awaken to their evolution, experiencing a ‘trigger’ that hastened them to advance sooner than most normal humans. \nThey are called Accelerators, individuals who went through a physical or mental metamorphosis that separated them from the ordinary. They harbor special skills and unique abilities to use at will. Their numbers have slowly increased over the years. Those who were discovered were registered in the government and had their lives changed in the consequence; those who fear being found out remained hidden.\nThe ones who underwent the natural phase of acceleration, showing obvious signs of change together with newly acquired abilities are called ACCELS. Those with superior innate skills are VERIFIERS, possessing no special abilities nor physical transformation yet have highly developed senses that identify them from the norm.\nThe government has long known of their existence. There were those who wanted to use such abilities to their advantage; those who wished to discover its origin; those who were against such methods; and those who refuse to have anything to do with them. \nThe presence of accelerators in the world, albeit discreet, were viewed as a threat. Factions soon formed within the government, extending into chains of other groups with motives of their own — pro and anti. One in particular concluded a research and put it into actions as security against accelerators was their excuse for conducting the tests\nThe ALTERS emerged, once regular humans who participated or were subjected in experiments that forced them to accelerate. The successful products, namely the survivors, came out with the same transformation as the Accels and with abilities of their own. However, the coerced transformation took its toll on their physical and mental state. Only the organization responsible for their change could provide the proper maintenance. \nIt was like releasing two tidal waves clashing when Alters, Accels and Verifiers clashed. To prevent further turmoil which can be considered they were accountable for, the government created an institution for Accelerators of all forms — and  possibly avert a warfare between these new classes of humans, and keep them from involving the normal ones.\nIn this new facility they are educated and trained to develop their skills and abilities, yet placing them on tenterhooks with each other, while keeping them form the public eye.\n-The first chapter covers how Xenon and Ami met t in H.A.D.E.S\nCategories: Action , Comedy , Fantasy , School Life , Sci-Fi , Supernatural , Original , ", home_url: "http://royalroadl.com/fiction/1593", is_translated: false, raws_url: nil, number_of_chapters: 0, last_modified: "2015-11-07 00:16:48"},

His toon was level capped, with all the finest gear, and his playstyle was without flaw. Even players that didn’t like him would admit he was one of the finest Paladins in the game.\nAfter a marathon thirty six hour gaming session, culminating in a victory against the invincible, [Minotaur King], his reward was a set of dice. Confused and a little annoyed Jason read the flavor text. It turned out, the dice were more than they seemed, they offered a reincarnation with an extended stat point pool, in effect a chance to have a level capped character that was better than any other in the game.\nIt was an opportunity he couldn’t pass up. Besides, he told himself, he was getting sick of the complicated playstyle of Paladins, always balancing magic and close combat, where one mistake could spell the end.

As a child, he was in an automobile accident. A freak whose body rejects most medical treatments, he was left scarred and disfigured. Angry, bitter and disgusted with the world, he had used Taereun: Battleground of the Damned to take out his frustration and anger, so he would not lose control and hurt or kill someone in real life. The closest he had ever come to being happy was living as Talon, during the eleven year search for Haven.\nHaving learned about the Power called ki, Mark McGuinness discovers that his human body is capable of channeling and using it. Once again armed with Power, he finds a way to travel from Earth to Taereun. He has questions he wants answered and people he owes. Whether mortal or divine, he will let no one and nothing stand in his way.\nBook 2: Slave Pits of the Tyrannical God\nBetrayed by the person he trusted most, Brand, formerly Mark McGuinness of Earth, has been enslaved and given to a DokkAlfar Wytch. Trapped deep within the heart of the Great Citadel of Gor’achaen, he is thrown into a gladiatorial stable and marked to be the new Champion for the stable.\nNot having any options or anywhere to run, Brand forms a compact with Elan’fer’sha, the Wytch who is his owner, and a mysterious human Smith, with Power far beyond anything Brand has ever seen used before. Somewhere within Gor’achen lie partial answers in Brand’s quest for vengeance, and in his rising to the status of Champion lies a road to the Wytch’s future.\nManeuvering for survival, Brand and Elan’fer’sha fight and work with and against each other in their struggles. Will they achieve their goals or will they fall before the centuries old plots plans of the ruling clans and clergy of a DokkAlfar empire?\nCategories: Action , Adventure , Drama , Fantasy , Martial Arts , Mature , Psychological , Sci-Fi , Tragedy , Original , ", home_url: "http://royalroadl.com/fiction/2022", is_translated: false, raws_url: nil, number_of_chapters: 0, last_modified: "2015-11-07 00:16:48"},

Of course the path had been riddled with obstacles that heroes were expected to face; just too many of them.\nHe had never expected betrayal at every turn, envy in every follower, and, worst of all, being a lap dog for those in power. ‘Slay such and such! Why? He’s evil of course! It is your duty!’ He hated all those who called upon him to be ‘Justice’ to further their own ends.\nThroughout his adventure he had found strong people determined to retain their strength through any means and weak people willing to drag down the strong to obtain power, but never had he found a weak person who was content being weak- nor did he find any strong players who wished to lose their power.\nHe didn’t want to lose his power, he didn’t want to be weak; he wanted to be free. To be able to unleash his bloodlust in a battle, kill unhindered, threaten, destroy- and enjoy the feeling of empowerment that came with it. Power is said to corrupt people, but those who are wise know the truth; power simply reveals a person’s true nature.\nHis nature was that of a beast; a ruthless, insane, bloodthirsty animal that wanted to fight and kill all those who stood in his way. So he had decided that he would be just that; a player killing chaotic player who wielded fear instead of exultation, who killed instead of showing mercy- a player who enjoyed the game by following his desires.\nCategories: Action , Adventure , Fantasy , Mature , Virtual Reality , Original , ", home_url: "http://royalroadl.com/fiction/2075", is_translated: false, raws_url: nil, number_of_chapters: 0, last_modified: "2015-11-07 00:16:48"},
